    "Your task is to develop a text-based video game focusing on the player profile, inventory system, and combat mechanics. Create a realistic player character with at least 10 inventory items, each with a description and an associated trait. Enjoy the process!\n",

    "Incorporate all the concepts we've covered so far, including files (read and write), JSON, operators, lists, optional tuples, functions, modules, and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type. Set attributes based on the choice (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
    "- **Inventory Display**: Implement a function to show the player's inventory.\n",
    "- **Item Details**: Write a function to provide detailed information about an inventory item (e.g., Knife: \"forged in the depths of Polymar\", +5 magic, edged weapon, one-handed).\n",
    "  - Bonus: Calculate bonuses when equipping and unequipping items.\n",
    "- **Inventory Management**: Create functions to add and remove items from the inventory.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Ensure the game can save and reload the player's character using files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on building the player and inventory system for your text-based adventure game (similar to Zork). The map and gameplay can be developed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Features:\n",
    "- **Player Profile**: Include player stats.\n",
    "- **Inventory System**: Implement a bag to hold items.\n",
    "- **Items**: Include 10 items, each with a description and trait (e.g., +5 magic).\n",
    "- **Concepts**: Utilize functions, loops, arrays, classes, and constants. You may also use files and structs if desired.\n",
    "- **Player Type Selection**: Allow players to choose their character type and set attributes accordingly (e.g., wizard: magic = 10, knight: magic = 0).\n",
    "- **Inventory Display**: Implement a function to show the player's inventory.\n",
    "- **Code Quality**: Keep your code clean and consider various player needs, as this project will be handed off to a partner for further development.\n",
